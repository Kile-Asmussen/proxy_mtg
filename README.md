# Unnamed Proxying Tool for MTG

Just a little toy tool for creating proxies for Magic the Gathering.

# Usage notes

You will need to download the Atomic Cards JSON file from [here](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/#atomiccards), since it is too large for github. (It is ecommended that you run it through a tool like [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to make it readable.)

You will also need to obtain the Beleren 2016 font, the Matrix Bold font, and the Goudy Medeival font through legitimate avenues. While a typeface itself cannot be copyrighted, the font encoding of each of these three fonts are all protected by licensing.

# Sale and resale of proxied cards

The proxy graphics produced by this tool are ***NOT*** to be sold or resold.
