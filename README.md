# Proxying for MTG

Just a little toy tool for creating proxies.

# Usage notes

You will need to download the Atomic Cards JSON file from [here](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/#atomiccards), since it is too large for github. (Recommend you run it through a tool like [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to make it readable.)
