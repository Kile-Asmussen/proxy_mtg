# Proxying for MTG

Just a little toy tool for creating proxies for Magic the Gathering.

# Usage notes

You will need to download the Atomic Cards JSON file from [here](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/#atomiccards), since it is too large for github. (It is ecommended that you run it through a tool like [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to make it readable.)

You will also need to obtain the Beleren font, the Matrix font, and the Goudy Medeival font through legitimate avenues. While a typeface itself cannot be copyrighted, the font encoding of each of these three fonts are all protected by licensing.

The proxy graphics produced by this tool are NOT to be resold.
